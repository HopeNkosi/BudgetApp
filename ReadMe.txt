2.In the vehicle class, when running the code, the user is prompted to enter the car make and model.
The software calculates the total monthly cost of buying the car. If the car has been repaid for over a period of 5 years, the 
software will notify the user on if he has exceeded 75% of his income, including loan repayments.
After all calculations of the monthly exepneses, the sofware will display all of the them in descending order.
